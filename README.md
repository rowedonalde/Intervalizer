Intervalizer is the ultimate interval quiz. The idea for this specific quiz was
suggested by my friend Chris Lucas (youtube: LucasDrumsandAudio), a drummer
who, naturally, doesn't encounter quite as many melodic intervals as the 
average musician.

##Installation
Installing Intervalizer is simple--just drop the intervalizer directory
anywhere your browser can grab an HTML page from. If you need to eschew the
root intervalizer directory, just make sure everything in it maintains the
same relative structure.

##Requirements
As of now, Intervalizer is incredibly simple--the only requirements bottleneck
lies in jQuery. Please visit
(the jQuery requirements page)[http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility] to
make sure your browser is supported.

##Instructions
Intervalizer will display the names of two musical notes and the melodic
direction (up or down). Click on the name of the interval between these notes
with respect to the indicated direction and click "Submit." If you answer
correctly, you will be prompted with a new question. If you answer incorrectly,
keep guessing--you have an unlimited number of tries to answer correctly.
